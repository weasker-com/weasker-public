**Personal note:**

This public repopsityory is a copy of the private production repository of weasker.com - A platform for interviwing groups of experts and brands and comparing their answers! 

Weasker is a project taking its first steps and Iv'e decided to share its code with the world. 

That way I hope to get others involved with the project and also show how I do things. 

I'm a rather new web-dev so the code is mostly not perfect, but I am doing my best to learn and improve it as I move forward. 

If you want to follow my process of building Weasker you can visit my personal website at: www.omribarmats.com
