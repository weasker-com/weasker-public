**Personal note:**
This public repository is a copy of the private production repository for Weasker.comâ€”a platform dedicated to interviewing groups of experts and brands and comparing their responses.

Weasker is a new project, and I've decided to share its code with the world. By doing so, I hope to engage others in the project and demonstrate my development approach.

As a relatively new web developer, I acknowledge that the code may not be perfect, but I am committed to learning and improving it as I progress.

If you're interested in following my journey with Weasker, visit my personal website at <a href="http://www.omribarmats.com">www.omribarmats.com</a> and contact me at <a href="http://www.omribarmats.com/contact">www.omribarmats.com/contact</a>
