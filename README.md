**Personal note:**

This public repository is a copy of the private production repository for Weasker.comâ€”a platform dedicated to interviewing groups of experts and brands and comparing their responses.

Weasker is a burgeoning project, and I've decided to share its code with the world. By doing so, I hope to engage others in the project and demonstrate my development approach.

As a relatively new web developer, I acknowledge that the code may not be perfect, but I am committed to learning and improving it as I progress.

If you're interested in following my journey with Weasker, visit my personal website at www.omribarmats.com.
